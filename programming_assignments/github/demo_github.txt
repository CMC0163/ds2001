Github workflow

We will spend time in class on the following:
- forking a repo (this makes a copy in your GitHub account, which you can modify)

We will fork the Apache Spark repo, which lives here:
https://github.com/apache/spark

- cloning the repo to local machine (this copies the fork to your local)
- creating a new file locally and adding to version control (git add, git commit)
- push the file back to GitHub (git push)
- discuss how to get repo updates with git pull
