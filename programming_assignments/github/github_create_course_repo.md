# Repo creation (in the GUI)

**INSTRUCTIONS:** We will spend time in class creating a repo, and adding files to the repo.

1) Visit your GitHub account and create new repo:  
repo name: `ds5100_prog_for_ds_[initials]`  
replace [initials] with your initials  

- make it PRIVATE; you can add users individually later  
- modify README file  
- create a .gitignore file  
- add a License (can select from dropdown, for example the permissive GNU v3)

2) Clone the repo to your computer under your repo folder  
- create a new folder: scripts

3) Copy a python script to the scripts folder, and push to GitHub (recall you'll want to do `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`)

4) Make sure the file is showing in GitHub repo

5) Add at least one teammate to your repo (under Settings you can add members)
